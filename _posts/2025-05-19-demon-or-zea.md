The last four months have been like a nightmare for me. __I found out my mother has cancer__—it was the thing I'd feared most in life. but Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon.


Well there are many versions of me inside me, and I don’t know which one is the real one.
There are so many things in this life, so many thoughts in my mind, so many songs in my Apple Music library, and so many problems in my life that I don’t know which ones are truly mine.


Have you ever watched The Sixth Sense?
Spoiler Alert: The movie is about a secret a kid tries to keep: He can see ghosts.
Well, I have a secret too. I can see a demon inside me that nobody else can see. Sometimes it’s my superpower and my best friend; other times, it’s my biggest enemy. It keeps me up all night, and my body aches. Recently, my body has been shaking, and it scares me because there’s so much turmoil inside me. When it spills out, it’s terrifying. What a cliché, huh? Je ne sais pas.

Can we talk? There’s nothing to tell you, I have so much to say. I can’t. Let’s just talk about movies. There are so many signs I can show you without speaking. Can you understand them? Are you that smart? Smarter than my demon? Because I don’t think I am. Not even my therapist is. i hate him btw. he loves money.

Have you ever watched Mommy? Do you want to hear my Fox Force Five joke? Maybe when he said: She wantend something and i just couldn't figure out what it was. I love how Billy Elliot can dance.

Do you even want to help me? Do you think I need your help? OMG, who added this song to my library? I don’t even like it.

__My mother doesn’t have cancer.__
It was a mistake. So now, what’s the problem? Should I make one up?

I don’t know who wrote this blog—me or my demon. Maybe both. Can you find my part in it?

Do you even want to help me? Do you think I need your help? Do I hate my demon?
You know I love games? my passion is making them. Is this a game I’ve made? Do I feel good about my demon? Do I really hate it?
Am I playing with you or am I playing with myself?
Can you figure it out? Can I?
Maybe you should kill me.
OMG, I love Kill Bill. i think the VOl-1 is the best one.

What is your favorite movie?
I love to watch people’s favorite movies.
