Hello,
I'm Zea, and this is my first website. Honestly, I'm not sure what exactly I should write here or if there are any rules to follow. But, just about ten minutes ago, I decided to write down the thoughts in my mind and share the things I do and the cool stuff I come across. Probably, no one except myself will see this, which is fine because it makes writing easier for me until I figure out what usually goes on awesome websites.

For now, the plan is to write to clear my mind, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun. Even though I'm not great at writing, it's always been a calming activity for me. There was a time in my life, when I was eight years old and had just learned to write, that I wanted to become a writer. But the following year, when I got more familiar with math, I changed my mind and wanted to win a Nobel Prize in Mathematics. I found out tonight that there is no Nobel Prize for Mathematics, and I'm relieved to have an answer for my nine-year-old self.

After considering various careers like writer, mathematician, footballer, football coach, heart surgeon, carpenter, painter, psychologist, and designer, I finally landed on programming and computer science. I don't know if I'll change my mind again or how long I'll continue with this, but right now, I'm having the best time of my life. I love learning, and diving into the vast world of algorithms and different programming languages gives me the ability to create various things. I love that today, I know a lot more than I did yesterday.

A while ago, someone told me that the more you code, the better you get at it, and it also makes you a better writer. I hope that when more people discover this site, I'll have become both a better programmer and a better writer, making my blogs interesting for others to read.
